# RoundRobinCPU

This JAVA program shows you the average waiting time of the processes that are being run on a CPU that uses the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. It asks you for the number of processes running, the arrival times of each, the burst times of each and the time quantum, then the algorithm shows you the wait times of each process and the average wait time, a number that is used mainly to judge the usability of a CPU scheduling system.

Currently it is structured mainly using arrays, I hope to find the time to optimize this algorithm using more effecient data structures. I also hope to add error handling soon.

To Run the program:

-Run it locally using a java compiler 

  -Issue this command to compile the program: javac r_robin.java
  
  -Issue this command to run the program: java r_robin.java
  
  -Follow the steps prompted once the program is run


I have also created a test file with 10 combinations of sample inputs which may be compiled and run the same way described above and does not require user input.
